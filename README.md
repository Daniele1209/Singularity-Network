# SingularityCoin
This is the cryptocurrency I'm working on

Use default `black` installation.

# Running
 Project Root Folder is `BlockChain`
 First you have to start the origin node, and then other nodes. Otherwise, child nodes will not connect to the origin.

 Run with command: `python3 -m BlockChain.Application <ipaddr> <port> <apiport> <origin_ipaddr> <origin_port> [publickeypath] [privatekeypath]`
